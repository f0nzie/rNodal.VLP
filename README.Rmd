# rNodal.VLP
The goal of rNodal.VLP is to provide analysis of correlations and mechanistic models for Vertical Lift Performance (VLP) of oil and gas wells.


## Installation

You can install rNodal.VLP from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("f0nzie/rNodal.VLP")
```


## Example
This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# test oil gravity conversion from rNodal.utils
library(rNodal.utils)

api_to_specific_gravity(40)
specific_gravity_to_api(0.8250729)
```
